With a brief that called for a textural score, with less of a focus on melodic elements and more of a focus on supporting the emotion of the monologue, Stephen approached the score with minimal time to spare. Completing the score across two days, he managed to just submit in time for the competition. It was a surprise and delight when the competition results were announced some few months later in the year. He is incredibly grateful for the recognition and thanks everyone who took part in the organisation, participation and adjudication of the competition.",

        "text": "Stephen O’Connell from Cmd Shift New was brought on to produce an original score, the foley and sound design for the short film Out of Sight, written and directed by Shannon Brimelow. Along with Travis Hodgkinson from Epic Videos (a Cmd Shift New Partner), the production was a success, bringing the story to life with everyone’s hard work and efforts. Cmd Shift New would like to thank the director, the production team, the actors and everyone who worked on the project for their hard work, professionalism and passion for the film. It was a pleasure to work with everyone. Out of Sight - Short Film Written and Directed by Shannon Brimelow Story Synopsis A boy and girl are running away, chased by unknown shady figures trying to hunt them down, their flashlights whipping past the camera as we follow the action. Finding a place to hide, keeping quiet and out of sight seems the best way to survive. As they weave through the bushes from one hiding place to another, the girl comes up with a plan to make a break for it, past the guards and out of danger. They manage to get so far, but under the bridge the guard dog sniffs them out and the jig is up. The girl yells run and pushes the boy out, but he trips and falls, landing on something that goes \"click\" as his hand comes down. Dread filling him, he lifts his hand, fearing the worst, but a simple children’s toy blurts out a happy chime and we finally understand that it is just a classic kid’s game of flashlight. Stephen from Cmd Shift New Brings the Epic Soundtrack to Life with Music and Sound Design Music With minimal dialogue and dramatically framed shots from the DOP, Travis, the final cut relied heavily on the audio and music to build the tension into the film. Leveraging the newly released sample library from Heavyocity, Symphonic Destruction, an epic soundtrack was created to capture the caution and danger of the chase and the dark undertones of what we think is a life and death situation. A percussive bass and rhythm pulses throughout much of the piece, with various lead textures taking on a minimal theme at peak moments. Blending synthetic, warped sounds the synthesised tones, the score took on a dark, yet bold vibe that pushes the film forward. At key moments towards the end, the dramatic scenes were underscored by heavily mutated organic bass textures and risers, hits and dissonant notes that left the audience unsettled. Finally, we realise that this high drama, tense and serious take on the game was all in the kid’s heads, the imagination immersing us into believing the threat is real. As the game ends, the music rises to take on a soft, happy and open feeling as the realisation that this is a birthday takes hold.",

        "title": "Arranging the Beatles: What You Can Learn From Orchestrating A Pop Song",
        "text": "Recently, I was teaching orchestration to some of my students in our music studio class, students who were majoring in composition for their degree, but who may never have had an interest in orchestral scoring. It’s part of the job of a lecturer, bridging the gap between what you are teaching and what your students can actually get out of it. Orchestration isn’t just for classical composers or those who have an interest in film scoring. No, its concepts are rooted in all western music. The idea of combining instruments to make new sounds can be found in electronic synthesis, or homophonic chordal parts played by the strings being essentially the guitar or piano line in a classic pop track. How do you show that bridge, between orchestration and the rest of the popular music styles that your students are interested in? Brainwave! Score a pop track in a live class demo! The reality is a lot more intense than that single sentence implies, as scoring something live is a daunting prospect for anyone. However, it turned out to be one of the best ways of instantly demoing everything discussed in class in a way that is engaging, informative and a little bit interesting! More on orchestration to come for this blog, but for now I want to share the outcome of that live demo. Below, I have included the notes I sent to class, so you too can see how I constructed this piece. Play 00:00 00:28 Mute Settings Enter fullscreen 00:00 Score Notes from Class Prominent Line Development The initial melody is played by the solo clarinet. It then develops by adding an octave above in both a divisi clarinet part (second player) and a flute part. The high notes of the octave above aren’t played by the clarinet to avoid a shrill sound, which could overpower the balance. An Oboe then joins in the descent, dovetailing the section together to soften the entrance of an instrument that is sonically different in characteristics from the flute and clarinet. The Bassoon joins for support at unison with the clarinet and all sections are now “tutti”, meaning all players available are playing those parts. The second violins and violas are introduced, violins at unison and violas an octave below, helping to strengthen the sound and create a warmer texture. The piccolo is added for a final layer at the thickest section. Homophonic Harmony and Voice Leading The main harmony structure is homophonic in nature, though it does deviate from it slightly. Homophonic would be the same rhythmic structure in all chordal parts, but I use dovetailing to achieve a blurred effect, reducing the awareness that separate parts are being added. For example, Violins II enter a beat early at a very low dynamic so that the effect is that by beat one of the following bar, where the note is required, the note has swelled in from nothing, reducing the attack of the chord. All notes are constructed with conventional voice leading. Large intervals are present at the bottom of the range and parts move in small intervals. The brass joins halfway through to support the extended range of the chords. Notice that the chords start very close together and progress to a larger ranger over multiple octaves. This helps reinforce the crescendo of the piece, allowing the bass and high registers to enter when they can take full advantage of their sonority. Textural Blends and Dynamics I’ve used a groups of similar textures mostly, to create the warm tones. The strings lead the homophonic chordal parts and the woodwinds lead the melody, with brass supporting the weight of the track. However, the Oboe and Bassoon are blended with the flute and clarinet early in the melodies development to create a new synthesised tone that cuts through the mix easier, especially as the brass enters. The dynamics have been intentionally written, with considerations for the natural sonority of the instruments in their relative registers. The brass is often one dynamic step below the rest of the orchestra to prevent them from overpowering the strings, which is easily done (it is why the brass are placed at the back of the orchestra, away from the audience and behind other players to absorb some of the initial blasts of sound). The dynamics have also been balanced at the beginning, the give the clarinet a preference in the mix and to prevent the strings from overpowering the melody. Lastly, the dynamics at the end allow the brass and woodwinds to create a final broken melody part. Orchestral Colouring and Effects The Sfz (loud with sudden force – sforzando) has been supported by timpani introducing a roll. The sudden loss of the brass and woodwinds also accentuates the forte piano (fp) in the strings. This creates an interrupted effect that introduces the broken melody that is about to arrive. The piccolo part acts as a colouration of the woodwind section in the tutti part. The part is lower in dynamics to avoid it overpowering in the mix, as it is there to blend with the flute and add power to that line. Tutti Section The powerful tutti section in bar 6 is a balance of instruments across multiple registers. The dynamics have been balanced to avoid overpowering in the brass and the piccolo added to keep the “airy” sound of the woodwinds coming through. Pointillistic Scoring The final section of the song leverages pointillistic scoring. The melody is in half speed, allowing a sense of slowing down without altering the tempo. It has then been passed around the instruments, one note played at a time, starting in the high woodwinds and working its way down to the low woodwinds and brass. This provides a sense of warmth and a feeling of reaching a finale.",

        "title": "REVIEW: Spitfire Audio’s BBC Symphony Orchestra Discover",
        "text": "There honestly hasn’t been a better time to break into the world of music composition. With the advent of technology and the internet, there has been an abundance of music and a blurring of lines between styles, genres and the previous chasm that was the divide between professional and novice (Campbell, 2019; JMC Academy, 2016). As we head into the 3rd decade of the century, the availability and accessibility of quality compositional tools is only getting better, with so many options available to suit you from student to master. Spitfire Audio’s latest edition, the BBC Symphony Orchestra Discover, is an insanely powerful library that offers quality sounds in a tiny digital footprint. At just under 200MBs (Gale, 2020), it still packs a realistic, quality library of orchestral sounds with a range of dynamics and articulations to use in your composition. The price is USD$49, but you don’t even have to break the bank if you don’t want to, with a FREE copy available after you complete a short survey with Spitfire Audio and wait the 14 day period for your copy to arrive (Zlatic, 2020). <br/> It is well worth the wait to access one of the best free orchestral libraries available (Zlatic, 2020), with a sample library that won’t leave you wanting for quality (Gale, 2020). Check out Spitfire Audio’s page here! What You Will Need Spitfire Audio is a stand-alone app, but will need a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) to access it (Stewart, 2019) and leverage its recording and compositional benefits. I recommend Logic Pro X, which is my DAW preference, the preference of Spitfire Audio’s Christian Henson when composing, and has recently received a major update that packs a huge number of new features. What Is On Offer with BBC Symphony Orchestra Discover Instrumentation and Articulations This is not just a barebones version of the bigger and more expensive BBC Symphony Orchestra libraries (Gale, 2020), this is a library in its own right that can stand up with the quality of its larger equivalents. There are 35 orchestral instruments in this library (“First look: BBC Symphony Orchestra – Discover by Spitfire Audio”, 2020) that span the most widely used and recognisable instruments in a symphonic orchestra (Gale, 2020), spread across the strings, brass, woodwinds and percussion. The mainstays are there, such as violins, clarinets, trombones and timpani, but also instruments that will expand your typical palette, including the celeste, harp, bass trombone and piccolo. Where the BBC Symphony Orchestra Discover version slims down it’s sound library to achieve its size and price point, is its included articulations, dynamic layers and round robin settings. The orchestra can sound quite thin and non-dynamic at times, as it uses a single sample when transitioning between dynamics from soft to loud, and can sound monotonous when playing repetitive notes (Evans, 2020) due to only having a single sample used in the round robin (a mechanism that normally alternates between varying samples of the same note to offer a more realist sound when repeating notes). It offers some great starting point articulations though, with legato, spiccato, pizzicato and tremolo in the strings, and legato and staccatissimo for most others (Zlatic, 2020). While the subtleties, like legato slurs between notes or the ornamental techniques like trills and turns, are not present, it does offer a balanced selection of initial techniques to experiment with. The inclusion of spiccato and staccatissimo articulations is a unique and pleasing compromise too, as they offer a more pronounced and accented sound than a traditional staccato articulation, making them more useful in wider scenarios with a more natural sounding quality to them. Control of Dynamics and Articulations The inclusion of Spitfire Audio’s previously used dynamic control methods helps to add the musicality to the streamlined library (Gale, 2020). The two controls in the UI control MIDI CC#1 – Dynamics and MIDI CC#11 – Expression. When used together, it triggers the dynamic crossfades between samples and adjusts the overall volume through expression to give you a realistic sound, especially in legato passages. With the sound libraries limited dynamic samples, though, it can at times seem a little soft (Evans, 2020), but when heard together it is clear that the instruments were balanced in the stereo field as a whole, rather than as an individual. This attention to the orchestra as a whole benefits the composer, both professional and novice, as all instruments are already balanced and panned for you as the conductor would hear them (Gale, 2020), allowing you to simply compose instead of mix. While it lacks the mic placement controls of the larger versions of the library that allow you to further tailor the sound (“First look: BBC Symphony Orchestra – Discover by Spitfire Audio”, 2020), it provides a working palette of tonality for you to experiment and write with that surpasses the sound libraries used by notation software. Collaboration Through Interchangeable Versions Where Spitfire Audio really outshines any competition is its interconnectivity with the other BBC Symphonic Orchestra libraries. If you are just starting out as a composer and would prefer someone else polish and mix your work, or you are working with a company or other composers on the same work, the ability to load up the DAW session and play the composition seamlessly with any of the BBC Symphonic Orchestra libraries is a gamechanger. This saves so much time, avoiding compatibility issues and reprogramming instruments to suit varying libraries. The session can simply be opened and the articulations, dynamics and expression will continue to function and sound the same (Gale, 2020). What this means for accessibility is a clear opportunity for new composers to get into the world of orchestral MIDI programming. The library features a clean UI that is intuitive to pick up and based on Spitfire Audio’s other free LABS sound libraries (Zlatic, 2020). This combined with its affordability and it’s quality democratises orchestrating and composing, allowing anyone with a laptop and a DAW to start working with orchestral libraries (“First look: BBC Symphony Orchestra – Discover by Spitfire Audio, 2020”). It could become the gateway for a new composer into the field, or a composition sketching palette for the experienced composer (Evans, 2020). My Review What Excels There is a lot to love about this library, but here are a few of my thoughts. The clean, intuitive UI is deceptively powerful and focusing your attention where it needs to be, on the music. It isn’t distracting, as some libraries can be, with hundreds of texture, articulation and patch combinations. It simply allows you to compose with quality samples and the most essential expression, dynamic and articulation options necessary. The stereo placement and balance of the orchestra also goes a long way to helping compose without distraction as well, cutting down on time setting up templates or premixing your DAW workspace without even having a single note played in yet. I have personally always admired Spitfire Audio’s dynamic controls, which rely less on velocity to define a dynamic sample and more on a dynamic control that feels closer to the real performer feeling of bowing harder or blowing more air through the instrument. Of course, on percussive instruments and percussive articulations (like spiccato), the velocity affects the dynamics in a more traditional and familiar way, but when those legato passages arrive in your composition, no longer do you have to surgically correct your low-skilled piano performance to make your instrument sound natural, a real plus to any compose like me who doesn’t play piano as their first instrument. A bonus little love of this library is the short load time. As a library with a weight below 200MB, it doesn’t require a lot of RAM or Storage to have this library on hand, ready to composer or record with. It also, doesn’t take very much time at all to load the samples when needed. I’ve worked with many sound libraries, some that take an age to load that really kills the creative mood when you are trying to capture that fleeting idea. On my setup, it is faster for me to open my BBCSO Discover Logic Pro X template than it would be to scrabble around for pen and paper, a real plus from a compositional workflow point of view. What To Be Aware Of While I’m personally sold on this library as a tool I will undoubtably use long into the future, there are a few limitations to be aware of that will affect your compositional journey. Namely, the limited articulations and dynamics. While what is available is amazing for a cheap or free library, the limited palette of options can entrap you into one of compositions most disheartening rookie mistakes, composing to the sounds. If you have ever written a piece of music using a notation software and then been disappointed when it sounds a little empty at the performance, you know what I’m talking about. When you compose using only what is available, you can limit your imagination and creativity, create inaccuracies in terminology (spiccato vs staccato, for example), and potentially compose a piece that will only every truly sound right when played by that digital orchestra. While this isn’t something that will be too concerning if you are just starting out, it is a trap worth remembering as you progress through your portfolio of works. Final Thoughts The overall quality and natural sound of this library is really what wins me over. Combined with its simple UI design and natural sounding dynamics, this is the perfect compositional tool to go from fist sketched idea to a full orchestral mock up. Will my compositions all exist inside BBC Symphonic Orchestra Discover’s sound library? Probably not, as I seek more in depth articulations, techniques and dynamic changes, but with the interchangeable versions option, it makes it really easy to use Discover as my sketch pad or manuscript and then upgrade those ideas into the “performance”, the final mixed work to show to clients. However you choose to use this incredible library, I have no doubt you will find it a pleasure to work with and be incredibly thankful to the team at Spitfire Audio for making this kind of experience possible.
